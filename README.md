# Yoga Online 

# Introduction

A website designed to promote Yoga training online. It contains a main page with a link to E-learning website with Yoga lesson videos and a page to sign up. If I wanted to further develop the website, I would require users to sign up first in order to see videos. I embeded a sample videos from youtube.com for the project. However for the final website I would create my own videos and published them regularly.

Below are responsive images of the three pages.

# UX

### Site Goals

The goal of the website is to attract users to watch yoga classes and buy some youga artefacts in the online shop (the shop doesn't exist yet).
This website is easy to navigate as well as aesthetically pleasing. Administrator should be able to easily add videos. The youga classes should be 
avaialable post signing up to the website.

### User stories

As a user:

* I want to watch yoga classes online
* I want to sign up to the site
* I want to log in to the site to watch videos
* I want to access the shop to buy yoga artefacts

As the site administrator:

* I want to be able to add new videos
* I want to update the website as little as possible

|Content reformats on smaller screens|pass|

* ### User and responsive design testing

I thorouglhy tested the website and its responsivness with Google Inspect functionality and 
    
    https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://ssmerd.github.io/online-yoga/

All user stories were tested and no faults were found. All links are working fine. The link to the Shop is redirecting to the code institute website.
I used a sample youtube videos, however, in the real website I would use my own. Also to access the videos, a user would have to be signed up.
Initially I had issues with reposnsivess but I managed to find css settings to make it look well.  This allowed me to adjust certain setings so the websites 
looked good on different devices. 
    
* ### Code and CSS validators

HTML and CSS validators were used to test the pages and css validity. No issues were found.


## Deployment

The yoga online page was deployed to GitHub. Below is the link:

# Future Featuers

Access to the videos would be secured by logging to website. First a user would have to sign up. Currently I don't have skills to do that.

I'd like to develop a shop selling yoga artefacts to monitize  the website. Currently I dont have skills to do that.

Also I would add a link to a donate website.
