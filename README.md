# Yoga Online 

# Introduction

A website designed to promote Yoga training online. It contains a main page with a link to E-learning website with Yoga lesson videos and a page to sign up. If I wanted to further develop the website, I would require users to sign up first in order to see videos. I embeded a sample videos from youtube.com for the project. However for the final website I would create my own videos and published them regularly.

Below are responsive images of the three pages.

# UX

### Site Goals

The goal of the website is to attract users to watch yoga classes and buy some youga artefacts in the online shop (the shop doesn't exist yet).
This website is easy to navigate as well as aesthetically pleasing. Administrator should be able to easily add videos. The youga classes should be 
avaialable post signing up to the website.

### User stories

As a user:

* I want to watch yoga classes online
* I want to sign up to the site
* I want to log in to the site to watch videos


As the site administrator:

* I want to be able to add new videos
* I want to update the website as little as possible

# Testing


* ### User and responsive design testing

| Test              | Outcome |
|-------------------|---------------|
|All navigation links take user to correct page|pass|
|Footer navigation and social & social links load correct pages|pass|
|Content reformats on smaller screens|pass|
|Newsletter form submits correctly|pass|
|Newsletter form prevents wrong data types|pass|
|Signup form submits correctly|pass|

All user stories were tested and no faults were found. All links are working fine.
I used a sample youtube videos, however, in the real website I would use my own. Also to access the videos, a user would have to be signed up.
Initially I had issues with reposnsivess but I managed to find css settings to make it look well.  This allowed me to adjust certain setings so the websites 
looked good on different devices. 

I thorouglhy tested the website and its responsivness with Google Inspect functionality and ui.dev/amiresponsive tool. This proved the most troublesome in the project. As advised by me mentor I should have built the mobile version first and then add functionality for bigger screen sizes, as opposed to bulding the destop version first.


    
* ### Code and CSS validators

# Working with GitPod

I used GitPod to work on the project. 

*   First I installed a GitHub GitPod extension in Chrome. This allows to create the workspace to work on the project on the repository
*   I usually starte by pressing GitPod extension as my GitPod workspaces usually time out.

# Future Featuers

Access to the videos would be secured by logging to website. First a user would have to sign up. Currently I don't have skills to do that.

I'd like to develop a shop selling yoga artefacts to monitize  the website. Currently I dont have skills to do that.

Also I would add a link to a donate website.
